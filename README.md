Introduction to Apple Butter
============================


Why are we here?

1. Firstly, we believe that knowledge should be useful, findable, reusable, and improvable.

2. Additionally, we believe that trust is the starting point for communities.

3. Accordingly, we believe that by recording our knowledge on various topics - even if incomplete and imperfect - we can both help others, and learn through discussion and iteration.

4. Tangentially, we believe our work has many stakeholders, and that our approaches and assumptions about making society better should be testable and transparent to the people whom they serve.



###This is a home for practical guides to how we do our work, the nuts and bolts: strategies, frameworks, steps, tips.
