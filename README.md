Introduction to Apple Butter
============================

Here's the long story short:

Many of us are interested in building a better city, society, country, and world. We're all on the same team.

1. Firstly, we believe that knowledge should be findable, reusable, and improvable.

2. Additionally, we believe that trust is the starting point for communities.

3. Accordingly, we believe that by recording our knowledge on various topics - even if incomplete and imperfect - we can both help others, and learn through discussion and iteration.

4. Tangentially, we believe our work has many stakeholders, and that our approaches and assumptions about making society better should be testable and transparent to the people whom they serve.


If you're curious about the name Apple Butter Jam: A jam is a way to improvise and collaborate to create something greater than the sum of its parts. Apple Butter, Alpha Beta. Better to start working together early, when we can have maximal impact on each other's success.
