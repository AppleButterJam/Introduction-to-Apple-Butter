How to Contribute
=================

There are three key ways to contribute.

1. Flag an issue
2. Edit a guide
3. Start a new guide.

To flag an issue - a problem, inaccuracy, question, etc. - click on the Issues icon to the right. It's a circle with an exclamation mark inside. If no one has raised it already, click Create a New Issue and follow the prompts to describe your issue and where we can find it. Thanks!

To edit a guide (I guess you could say things are getting pretty serious), click on the guide name, then edit. Then have fun. Seriously, you're allowed. Ownership is a non-term in these parts.

To start a new guide, start from the AppleButterJam main page [https://github.com/AppleButterJam] and see if there's an appropriate repository. If there isn't, there's a big Create New Repository Button staring at you, and you can start a new "bucket" of guides. If there's a natural home for it, head there and either way, click the plus symbol, bordered to the left and bottom, next to the repository name.

If you're editing or starting a new repository, here's a cheatsheet for Github Markdown: http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet. But honestly? You can get pretty far with the following:
