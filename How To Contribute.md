How to Contribute
=================

There are three key ways to contribute.

1. Flag an issue
2. Edit a guide
3. Start a new guide.

To flag an issue - a problem, inaccuracy, question, etc., or to request a new guide - click on the Issues icon to the right. It's a circle with an exclamation mark inside. If no one has raised it already, click Create a New Issue and follow the prompts to describe your issue and where we can find it. Thanks!

To edit a guide (I guess you could say things are getting pretty serious), click on the guide name, then edit. Then have fun. Seriously, you're allowed. Ownership is a non-term in these parts.

To start a new guide, start from the [AppleButterJam main page](https://github.com/AppleButterJam) and see if there's an appropriate repository. If there isn't, there's a big Create New Repository Button staring at you, and you can start a new "bucket" of guides. If there's a natural home for it, head there and either way, click the plus symbol, bordered to the left and bottom, next to the repository name. Call it title.md to use the Markdown language that makes it pretty.

If you're editing or starting a new repository, here's a [cheatsheet for Github Markdown](http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet). But honestly? You can get pretty far with the following:

[#]Heading

[##]Sub-heading

[###]Sub-sub-heading

One asterisk around words in italics
